title: 'My Family, My Community, and Me'

I live on the Northeast side of Indianapolis with my wife Kelsey and our son Lincoln in our house full of rescue dogs and cats. Follow me on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/craigsturgis/) and you'll catch a glimpse of the zoo.

### Community

We live in a society and I believe we all have a responsibility to give back and make it better.

Right now most of our family's community energy goes into animal welfare. Kelsey is a long time volunteer with [Heaven After Hell Animal Rescue](http://www.heavenafterhellrescue.org/) and I was drafted to help foster and I assist here and there with volunteering and support. I am also an ASPCA supporter.

I try to do my best to stay engaged in civics - especially locally. My current local civics focus is on ensuring [equal justice and reducing police violence](https://craigsturgis.com/posts/black-lives-matter/)

I support hunger relief organizations like [Gleaners](https://www.gleaners.org/) and [Second Helpings](https://www.secondhelpings.org/).

I have a strong interest in helping people who didn't all get the same opportunities that I've had to develop their talents, skills, and careers to be the best members of our community and society they can be. 

I am also trying to do my part to preserve and restore the environment our society depends on.

### Hobbies

My first hobby is to always be learning things and trying to figure out how to apply them to my daily life. 

I also like to run, walk, or just generally stay active. 

I love following and tinkering with tech. 

I have an amateur interest in taking care of my home and doing small projects that stretch my skills. 

I play guitar and sing - but the [band](https://www.facebook.com/sundaynightkarate) is on [hiatus](https://www.facebook.com/Average-Height-6863333340/).
