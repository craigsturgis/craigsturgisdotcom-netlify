title: What's the plan?
---

#### What I am planning to do to the website itself, not necessarily its content

### Planned for the near future

* Fix netlify CMS previews on about, generic pages
* Fix main site hero image to work correctly on iphones

### Backlog

* Create a mailing list and ways to sign up for it
* Create a "system" page to link to / from posts about it
* Change layout so less recent ipads don't get the mobile layout and a giant version of my face
* Fix weird characters in archive post titles
* Make sure site is using san serif system fonts
* Content posts should have a serif font for easier reading on the site itself
* Create a books section for books I read
* Add reading time to posts
* Respect dark mode settings
* Email this post button
* Make sure the sitemap is SEO friendly
* Fix google font console errors
* Fix home page headshot so it uses the gatsby image rendering
* Self hosted contact form that's on par with typeform

### Completed

* Create a core values page / set of pages - went with a post for now
* Set up netlify editorial workflow for draft posts with pull requests, etc
* Make sure bulma version used is up to date (upgraded to 0.8.0)
* Add dates back to posts template
* get google analytics working
* Make sure letsencrypt ssl is working
* Recreate [affiliate links](/affiliate-links) page
* Create this site plan page
