#### What I am planning to do to the website itself, not necessarily its content

### Planned for the near future

* Add dates back to posts template

### Backlog

* Fix main site hero image to work correctly on iphones
* Change layouts so less recent ipads don't get mobile layout
* Content posts should have a serif font for easier reading
* Create a books section for books I read
* Create a mailing list and ways to sign up for it
* Create a core values page / set of pages
* Make sure the sitemap is SEO friendly
* Make sure bulma is up to date
* Fix google font console errors
* Fix home page headshot so it uses the gatsby image rendering

### Completed

* get google analytics working
* Make sure letsencrypt ssl is working
* Recreate [affiliate links](/affiliate-links) page
* Create this site plan page
