Mr James Brown Jr got me thinking earlier today with his “post super bowl resolutions” he posted.  Normally I’m not big on New Year’s resolutions, I like more random resolutions- I feel like they stick better, so here are a few:

1) Try to be a nicer dude. It seems to me I lose my patience a lot more easily than I used to these days. We all have our bad moments and February weather certainly doesn’t help even if you’re not the type to get seasonal affective disorder, but if I’ve been a jerk to or around you in the past- I’m sorry and I’m going to try and do better.

2) Dial back some cynicism.  Conan’s [final words][1] on his Tonight show got me thinking about this, and while I consider myself a realist I’m going to try and see things as they are but try and lose some of the edge I tend to have.  Something that really bothers me about the social networking sharing craze is it does highlight just how negative a lot of people let themselves be, and I’d rather try to be positive.

3) Get better at staying focused.  It seems like I used to be able to keep focused on even the silliest tasks.  I used to get a kick out of being really fast at restocking the shelves when I worked at hollywood video, and I don’t seem to have the ability to hunker down quite like I once did.  I let myself get distracted too easily, and I need to improve on that whether it’s at work or in my mini training or in practicing music or knocking the rust off of my blog or whatever.

Anyhow, this is not fishing for compliments or anything I’m looking for a big response on, just something I wanted to share that called for something longer than a twitter post or facebook status.  If I’m doing something against the spirit or the letter of the above feel free to call me on it, I’m just some jerk trying to make it in this world.

(P.S. watch Chuck[^1], it’s an entertaining throw away show and however cheesy it may seem watching it makes me want to be a nicer person almost every episode, it contributed to #1, ha.)

 [^1]: Chuck really was a great show, even if they had a hard time ending it well. I would still recommend catching the series. (08/2013)
