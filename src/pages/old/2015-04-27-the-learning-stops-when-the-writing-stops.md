It's really easy to give or listen to advice. I've given plenty of mostly unqualified advice to people who didn't really ask for it most of the time. I've read a lot of advice and taken really useful things from it- I'm a good chunk through a [book][1][^1] that would qualify as just that right now. I have a drive to learn about great new ways to do things and a too healthy fixation on finding the perfect set of tools to help me and everyone around me do things the _right way_ from now on.

 [^1]: About 60% of the way through I'm finding some of the thinking to be really useful and a lot of the specific content to be dated and very much "do what I did to get rich!" seminar kinds of stuff. Still worth the read so far.

Coming off of a week of vacation and stepping back, it's funny to reflect on all the lessons and habits I find the most valuable in my life and in my career to this point were things I read or was told about or even talked about myself ad nauseum, but didn't really absorb until I really tried it myself instead of talking about it or researching 10 different tools to find the perfect one to do it.

Recently at [Haven][2] we announced our arrival to the wider world[^2]. I'm immensely proud of what my team and our whole company have accomplished so far, but I know how much more we need to do and how much better it can be as we try new things, find ways to test our results, and improve upon them. I want our company and products to be better, and most of all _I_ want to be better, so I am going to commit to doing more things both professionally and personally with the bare minimum of prerequisites, because looking back that's how I learned and discovered most effectively- by doing.

 [^2]: Or at least the wider Indianapolis metropolitan area.

I'm also going to commit to make time to write about my experiments whenever possible, because writing is something I miss, and because I need to take my own medicine. I talk a lot about how writing is thinking but as you can see by my post history I'm either not thinking much or I'm doing it in private. I am to improve upon that as much as I can. [Always bet on text.][3]

I have some ideas. I may write a series[^3] about my ongoing experiments in product management coming from developer world. I may write about the classic [movie][4] I just watched for the first time tonight. I might write about the [book][5] I read on vacation that should _be_ a movie. I might write a super technical post about code that should probably be a question and answer on [stackoverflow][6]. I may write a review of a grape Mr. Misty[^4] 12 years after I said I would. But, I am setting a goal to write weekly, and I am going to challenge my inner critic to lay off a bit before obsessing over each thing I write, because the result of thinking more about what would be a good enough post to write vs. just writing so far is that I just stop writing publicly. I hope if I fall short whatever peanut gallery exists finds ways to remind me to do what I said I'd do. As previous posts to this site now show in the footnotes, future me will probably chastise current me regardless.

 [^3]: Inspired by series from [Brent Simmons](http://inessential.com/vespersyncdiary) and [David Smith](http://david-smith.org/watchkit/) among others, which I enjoyed even without knowing much about the surrounding material

 [^4]: I think a Mr. Misty is called an Arctic Rush or something now. Some people are unjustifiably mad about Pluto not being a planet, I am unjustifiably mad about this.

[Coach Sellers][9] used to say "the learning stops when the writing stops." I've learned a whole lot without writing about it afterwards, but I feel like had I done so I would consider those ideas more carefully and have more clarity and understanding around them. I hope in the process to throw off some artifact that is useful or at least makes someone else crack a smile, but otherwise I am going to write to think, and to hopefully learn. An object in motion stays in motion.
