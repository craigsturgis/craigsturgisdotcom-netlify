I had a great time going on the Better Product Podcast. 

I got to talk with two people I have a lot of respect and admiration for about things that I really love doing and advocating for in digital product development.

Anna and Christian are great interviewers, and their segment after my appearance is really helpful too.

The entire [Innovatemap](https://innovatemap.com/) team are pros and have been my teachers and partners in learning so much throughout my career.
