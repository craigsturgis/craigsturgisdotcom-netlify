# The Biggest mistake in digital products

hook - story about haven (?)

## “That’s one of the best ideas I’ve ever heard.”

My cofounders and I heard different variations of that phrase often when telling people about what we were building. 90% of the time our pitch was met with plenty of encouraging, validating responses.

We had built a small alpha test app to gather data to support our pitch and had 25 or so active users from our friends and family.

With data in hand from real people in our target market, we strengthened our pitch and relatively quickly closed a million dollar seed round^1. Seven figures of validation, and we were going to put it to work.

^1 At the time in 2014, this was a relatively large seed round, especially for a company based in the midwest.

We turned the alpha test off - it was too labor intensive and [didn’t scale]. We hired a team of people and pivoted to full heads down building out as much of our expansive vision as we could.

Even with the founders taking significantly less than market salaries, our burn rate gave us about a year - there was no time to lose.

Months later^2, we launched. People signed up and used the app, but it was not the overwhelming flood we expected.

^2 SIX months later to be specific. (facepalm)

I was so confused. People kept telling us it was such a good idea! Why were so few people using it?

## The Mistake

The biggest mistake in digital product development is fooling yourself into believing the specific solution you’re building is more validated than it is.

That’s not to say that the *vision* you have isn’t something that will succeed. It might even be transformational.

But, building a valuable enough subset of your vision is harder and will probably take much longer than you think.

I’ve seen this mistake play out directly many times in my career. I hear about it from friends, and can even spot it pretty quickly from the outside looking in. It happens at startups, big public companies, and everywhere in between.

I really feel for everyone grinding away and doing their best trying to make a big bet pay off. It does work, the odds are just very small.

But even when it does work, it reinforces a confidence that is almost certain to backfire at some point on people who haven’t experienced a failure or two.

## Words to be wary of

So many forces are pushing towards shifting away from discovery and going heads down building until things are “ready.”

The assumption that leadership *knows* exactly what to build is hard to dislodge, especially when leaders believe it.

Here are some common phrases that should set off alarm bells:

- “Our customers are telling us what they want. We just have to go build it!”
- Potential customer: “That sounds really great. Let me know when it’s ready and I’ll take a look.”
- “I just met with (dream prospect) and they said if we build (feature x,y,z), they’ll sign!”

None of these things are bad in and of themselves, unless they lead you to stop the ongoing process needed to get to the specifics that will make them true.

You need some amount of luck to get the details right no matter what. To make more of your own luck, the right details have to be *discovered* alongside customers and users.

What people **do** is worth so much more than what they say. It’s important to get in position to observe what they actually do as early and often as you can.

## How not to be fooled

It’s really hard not to learn this lesson the hard way. But here are some things that I’ve found to be helpful:

### Budget smarter

In the digital product business you’re budgeting money, people, and time.

Unfortunately you can’t buy time with any amount of money, and you can’t un-spend money you’ve already spent.

Whether you’re putting together an annual operating plan, a product roadmap or deciding how you choose to allocate your sweat equity, it’s all budgeting. Doing it wrong is deadly to businesses.

Assume you’ll need more than what it will take just to build the first version of something before you’ll see good results. You’ll probably need a good deal more.

Given that, how does it change your approach to what you budget for?

Instead of just planning out features to build, think in terms of the specific goal you’re trying to accomplish with that feature, giving you room to find multiple possible paths to it.

Get something interactive in front of your target market as soon as you can. Do it even if it’s just to a small private group, and even if it’s all just people behind the scenes not scaleable technology. The most important thing is learning whether it’s useful or at least promising to your target customer. If you can’t get them to care or engage, you’re in the danger zone.

If you’re building something new on top of a product that’s already viable, don’t commit to unrelated features right after what’s in progress is slated to be done, especially if you really need what’s in progress to work.

### Talk to target customers the right way

It’s obvious to say you should have conversations with customers and potential customers as often as you can.

The challenge is that having the wrong kinds of conversations can give you what feels like validation but isn’t. There are great ways to do research that isn’t heavyweight or expensive.

[The Mom test] is a short book (and the best audiobook in this genre I’ve ever listened to) and should be required reading for any leader in this business.

More formal [switch interviews] are more effort to learn, but pay big dividends.

Whatever you do, don’t avoid Including key team members from all disciplines when having and especially digesting the conversations you have. It’ll uncover many more insights vs. trying to translate insights into “requirements” without that important context.

### Measure Leading Indicators

It’s easy to figure out whether you’re making the revenue and the margins you need.

The problem with the financial metrics people focus on is that they happen as the result of work that was done in the past. Maybe a LONG time ago.

What can you measure to help you know whether you’re on the right track?

Most often, your “leading” indicators of success won’t be obvious at first. Take your first best guesses, make sure you can measure them and report on them, then review with your team. Plan for the time to update measurements as you learn more over time and find where the correlations are.

Being able to measure success indicators should be as core to your product development process as testing for bugs.

Again, what your customer and target customers *do* is a much more important validation signal than what they *say* they will do.

How can you build in a way that you can measure actions and not words sooner?

## Burn Baby Burn

Back to when I was a cofounder.

After some weeks of scrambling post launch, we did get back to doing things that didn’t scale and found many ways to shorten our feedback loop.

We did some really cool experiements I’m proud of and got some really great insights from customer interviews.

But it was too late. We had burned too much money and couldn’t recover enough momentum before we just ran out of cash.

## “It'll happen to yooooooou”

You might think it was obvious we were making a dumb move.

In my experience it’s by far the most common approach people take when building something.

Sometimes it even works! Just not near as often as it’s tried.

Odds are, most people who do this work will have to learn the lesson the hard way along with me. Maybe more than once.

Find ways to feed your optimism without believing too much of your own hype.

It’s simple, but not easy.

Good luck!
