I wish we lived in a world where this didn’t need to be said. But, the facts on the ground make it necessary to be clear.

I believe black lives matter, and they deserve the same right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness many of us take for granted.

I’m making a commitment to put thought and intention into what I can *do* so that hopefully my infant son - or anyone else's child - doesn’t have to think about whether it still needs to be said. That way he can put more of his energy into other ways to help make a better and more just world.

I’m fortunate enough to have grown up studying and discussing books like Native Son and Cry, The Beloved Country alongside traditional canon books like the Odyssey. I’ve had many role models including my parents who showed me how to value everyone regardless of what they look like. I've had opportunities to get to know and learn from people who don't look like me. None of this makes me especially enlightened, but I think it did give me more exposure than the average white person to the inhumanity that black people disproportionately face.

But, I haven’t done enough. I’ve spoken up when people have said or done something racist, but not consistently. I haven’t done much in the way of direct action to help atone for our country’s original sin beyond a few small donations here or there. 

I'm sorry, and I'm committing to do better.

Black and brown people deserve equal justice before the law that they are not getting across the board. In far too many cases interactions between these people and the justice system result in violence and injustice. I’m going to put my focus here first, and locally where I live and have the most ability to make a difference. 

As of this writing, Indianapolis gets a green check on [1 out of 8 criteria](https://8cantwait.org/city/indianapolis-in) that the research done by [campaign zero](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/) has laid out as correlating with drastically reduced police violence.

Mayor Hogsett has [asked for a reformed use of force policy](https://twitter.com/IndyMayorJoe/status/1267548562503630848), and a new use of force review board [has been created](https://fox59.com/news/mayor-hogsett-impd-to-speak-about-ongoing-policing-reforms/) with civilian participation. I promise to at minimum do my part to understand how these reforms are working to provide accountability and ensure justice is done the right way, and then provide pressure to ensure more measures shown to be effective are put in place. This first set of criteria seem achievable quickly, and a decent first step of many.

There’s of course more to do, more to learn, and I'm going to work to do that. But, I want to move forward imperfectly now towards a common vision of justice, equality, and peace for _everyone_, starting where the need is greatest. Reach out if you are able and willing to help me do that better. 

I'm on the path either way, looking to follow more than lead until I learn more.
