When I think of core values, I think about the clearly articulated ideas that explain how people live their life, and what they aspire to. These are mine. 

They have [evolved](https://github.com/craigsturgis/philosophy/commits/master/life/core-values.md) over time and I expect that to continue, just hopefully not too much.

### Every day is a great day.

We only get so many days, and it’s tempting to live for some imagined future when things will be great. 

I can’t control everything that happens to me and around me, but I can control my mindset, reaction, and whether I _do my best_[^1] to make each and every day a great one for myself, my family, and others.

### Build and be open to love and trust.

Days can only be so great without the love and shared experience of family and friends. I want to do my best to build on the love in my life and especially the trust that makes all relationships stronger.

At the same time, I want to do my best to be more open to receive love and trust in return, something that has been more uncomfortable for me than giving it in the past.

### Always be learning,  applying, and sharing. Form strong opinions, loosely held.

The primary intrinsic motivation in my life has been to learn.

I want to do my best to always be feeding that thirst for knowledge, applying the results, and sharing what I’ve learned with others. 

I support strong opinions, loosely held: having a point of view that is clear and direct, but I do my best to be humble and open to learning from others with another point of view. 

I especially try to be open to perspectives from those with different backgrounds, experiences, and genetics from mine to make sure I’m learning as much as I can and staying mindful of biases I may not ever be able to fully offset.

### Be thoughtful, intentional, effective, and kind.

I do my best to be thoughtful— regularly taking time and energy to reflect and consider my actions and their impact. I try to work to know myself and the landscape I inhabit.

Then, I do my best to be intentional and plan the specifics of how I want to act and try to create systems and habits to support that. I am always working to fight against going through life on “auto-pilot”, knowing that my monkey brain is fighting to put me back there at all times.

Over time I work to gauge whether my actions are effective at having the impact and outcomes I want over just optimizing for what feels good or efficient.

Through it all, I try to work to be kind to others. My default presence can sometimes be intense, short, and forceful and at worst condescending. I do my best to try to counteract that and to be kind both in small actions and in larger effect.

### Act in good faith. Seek out and tell the truth.

I try to take action in ways that openly reflect my core beliefs and values. Obscuring them can be an easier path to being “effective” but in a way that I believe would be hollow and unsatisfying.

The world is full of people who act in bad faith. The world I want to live in is one in which that is acknowledged but good faith is supported and rewarded. I want to do my best to walk the path I want others to walk and help make that world.
