My default reaction when politics comes up in conversation is to be uncomfortable. Even if the person I'm talking to is likely to hold the same position I do, it doesn’t change my reaction much. I'm only at ease if I’m talking to someone who I often have deeper political conversations with. This doesn’t make for a lot of pleasant back and forth in any presidential election year, much less this one.

I’m still working to understand why I react this way. It’s part of everyone’s civic responsibility in a representative system to engage each other. It's the only way to help make the best choice on who runs the government. I think the primary reason I hesitate is that the topics that dominate political conversation seem so surface level. They're more slogans or even memes without a lot of conscious thought put into them.

The most common outcomes of political discussion seem to be: 

1) Feeling great about how strongly we agree and how crazy the “other side” is. 

2) Talking (yelling) past one another, many times to the point of souring what should be meaningful relationships.

I don’t have much interest in either of those things. What I want is to get to the heart of what the person I’m talking to is _for_ that informs their opinions on a surface issue.

But, that’s a conversation with mutual give and take that requires long stretches of time and a willingness to engage. Even if the other person is open to it and free to spend the time, it’s a lot of emotional and intellectual labor. So, nine times out of ten I change the subject or keep my mouth shut. Which also doesn’t make me feel great.

Last year, someone I follow for (tech analysis) introduced a concept that I find to be a simple tool that can help in these situations: a (principle stack).

A principle stack means getting clear on what principles you are for vs. what you are against as the first step. But, what happens when those principles come into conflict? Which one do you choose over the other? If you were to do this for every principle you stand for you would have a single top to bottom prioritized “stack”.

It’s probably the computer scientist in me, but I find myself thinking about almost everything in that frame now.

I believe the vast majority of people in America share most of the same principles. But, small differences in how we prioritize those principles can seem irreconcilable. Instead of doing the work to try to understand those differences with empathy, it's easier to question motivations. This helps build an increasing and self reinforcing set of grievances. There are people in this world with bad motivations, but far fewer than many people seem to believe.

Now, we're sorted into two "sides" where what we're against seems to be the main thing over what we're for. It's dangerous territory for our collective common good as Americans and human beings as a whole. It doesn’t have to be a zero sum game.

I am a huge proponent of the “(Five whys)” method of root cause analysis in my work life. But, it’s also a mindset I find useful for almost everything I’m trying to understand. You only have to “ask why” twice vs. five times in most political conversations to get to the root of what seems like an intractable difference.  It's much easier to have a productive conversation if you figure out you 80% agree in principle. Even if it's closer to 20% or 0%, then at least it's clear it's not worth the effort save the energy for when it is. I think a “supermajority” of Americans are closer to 80% agreement in principle on most things. But, grievances are piling up all the time. The incentives to exploit differences for political and financial gain keep getting reinforced.

We have serious problems to work out amongst ourselves, no matter what the results of this upcoming election are. It seems likely to get worse before we can successfully make it better. I hope not. We are on the brink of an accelerating increase in widespread suffering. We have to counteract that either way, but our odds get much smaller if we can’t find more common ground to stand on. 

I hope that more people can use ideas like the principle stack as a shortcut to get to the root of issues rather than sticking to the surface level. I'm going to try. If we engage with what the real differences in principle are, we stand a much better chance at working out those problems.

I’m happily pulling the lever *for* Joe Biden ahead of November 3rd. I don’t think one leadership change at the top will solve all of our problems, far from it. But, right near the top of my stack is a belief in the principle of working in good faith within the imperfect system we have over tearing it down or finding ways to undermine it. I’ve concluded based on his actions that Joe will do his best to try to do that. 

If you think I’m crazy, I’m guessing there’s a good chance we probably have more principles in common than we don’t, and it’d be interesting to talk about how we’ve prioritized them differently and why.

While I breathe, I hope.
