The Mandalorian is obligated by creed to reunite the baby with its own kind.

Galactica is out to find Earth.

Every house member in Westeros wants to control the iron throne.

Many of my favorite TV series follow a similar structure. Whether they’ve chosen it intentionally or not, the main characters have a mission. But, they also have to solve a lot of other smaller problems during shorter story arcs along the way.

This is how I see this next phase of my career as an independent consultant.

## Digital Product Mercenary

In digital product development, you stand the best chance of success if you cultivate a team of [missionaries, not mercenaries.](https://svpg.com/missionaries-vs-mercenaries/)

But, there are times when hiring a mercenary makes sense. I want to be the one a leader hires for a while to help assemble and support the team of missionaries that fits where they are in their journey.

I’ve spent my 15+ years in tech gaining tons of depth in digital product development and [range](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484) across all the other business disciplines in a variety of markets. I want to leverage what I’ve learned so far and my strength in learning quickly and communicating clearly to help organizations move forward in a better way.

Digital product development is *hard*. Many common models for developing them are a bad fit for so many companies and don't align incentives properly. Even with tons of talent, funding, and expertise, you need a whole lot of luck to succeed.

There are ways to improve your odds though.

I am making a bet that I can develop and provide services that are less transactional and provide a better fit for organizations that are in a few sweet spots.

I am unashamedly treating my business as a “lifestyle business.” I don’t want to grow a big agency.

What I do want is to support a comfortable life for my family, and create the flexibility to be very involved before my kid goes to school.

I also want to carve out 20% time plus funding to experiment with new ideas that interest me in markets I have less experience in but lots of interest.

I want to help as many organizations as I can within that framework, with the hope that I find a spark in the process.

## My mission

I'm a builder at heart. My mission during this phase is to search within those constraints for a market where I can build a business that produces what is best represented by the [meme of “Ikigai.”](https://theviewinside.me/what-is-your-ikigai/)

![ikigai](/img/ikigai.png "Ikigai")

I want to do what I’m good at building something I'm interested in that makes money and makes the world better if even in a small way, while living as many great days as I can. [Productive entrepreneurship](https://hbr.org/2017/06/is-america-encouraging-the-wrong-kind-of-entrepreneurship) plus a good life.

It typically takes 5-15 years to see a product business through to maturity if you can keep it alive.

When the time is right to devote my work life fully to building something new, I hope to be confident that I’ve got the best chance to produce ikigai along the way for me and as many others as possible.

This is the way.
