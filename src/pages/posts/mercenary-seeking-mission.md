The Mandalorian is obligated to reunite the baby with its own kind.

Galactica is out to find Earth.

Every house member in Westeros wants to control the iron throne.

Many of my favorite TV series follow a similar structure. Whether they’ve chosen it intentionally or not, the main characters have a mission. But, they also have to solve a lot of other problems each episode along the way.

This is how I see this next phase of my career as an independent consultant.

## Digital Product Mercenary

In digital product development, you stand the best chance of success if you cultivate a team of [missionaries, not mercenaries.](https://svpg.com/missionaries-vs-mercenaries/)

But, there are times when hiring a mercenary makes sense. I want to be the first choice a leader hires to help assemble, expand, and support their team of missionaries.[^1]

[^1]: This is not to suggest these team members, even as missionaries should not be compensated fairly. But, that's another post.

I’ve spent more than 15 years in tech gaining tons of depth in digital product development plus [range](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484) across all the other business disciplines. I've built, contributed to, and managed products in multiple types of markets and a couple of different industries. 

I want to leverage my experience, my strength in learning quickly, and ability to translate and communicate to help leaders and teams move forward in a better way.

Digital product development is ***hard***. Many common models for developing them are a mismatch for what so many organizations really need and don't align everyone's incentives well. Even if you have access to tons of talent, funding, and expertise you need a whole lot of luck to succeed.

There are ways to improve your odds though.

I am making a bet that I can develop services that are less transactional and give organizations that are in a few sweet spots a better chance at success by working with me for a few months.

## Guardrails

I am treating my consulting business as a “lifestyle business.” I don’t want to grow a big agency.

What I do want is to provide tons of value to clients, support a comfortable life for my family, but also create more flexibility. I want to be very involved with my son before he goes to school. I also want to give back to the community more than I have been.

Professionally, my goal is be able to carve out [20% time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project) to experiment with new ideas that interest me, in markets I have less exposure to.

I want to help as many organizations as I can within that framework, with the hope that I find a new spark in the process.

## My mission

I'm a builder at heart. My mission during this phase is to search for a problem space where I can build a business that produces something best represented by the [meme of “Ikigai.”](https://theviewinside.me/what-is-your-ikigai/)

![ikigai](/img/ikigai.png "Ikigai")

I want to do what I’m good at: building something I'm interested in, that makes money. But, I also want that thing to be something that sustainably makes the world better if even in a small way. If I can do that while living as many [great days](/core-values) as I can, then that's the professional dream. [Productive entrepreneurship](https://hbr.org/2017/06/is-america-encouraging-the-wrong-kind-of-entrepreneurship) plus a good life.

It typically takes 5-15 years to see a digital product business through to maturity, assuming it doesn't fail completely along the way.

When the time is right to fully devote my working life to building something new for that long, I hope to have spent this phase building confidence I've found the right "spot" to make my professional home. The best environment to produce ikigai along the way for me, my family, and as many others as possible.

This is the way.
