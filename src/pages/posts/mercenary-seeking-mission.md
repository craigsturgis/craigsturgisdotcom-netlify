The Mandalorian is obligated by creed to reunite the baby with its own kind.

Galactica is out to find Earth.

Every house member in Westeros wants to control the iron throne.

Many of my favorite TV series follow a similar structure. Whether they’ve chosen it intentionally or not, the main characters have a mission. But, they also have to solve a lot of other smaller problems during shorter story arcs along the way.

This is how I see the next phase of my career as an independent consultant.

## Digital Product Mercenary

In digital product development, you stand the best chance of success if you cultivate a team of [missionaries, not mercenaries.](https://svpg.com/missionaries-vs-mercenaries/)

But, there are times when hiring a mercenary makes sense. I want to be the first choice a leader hires to help assemble, expand, and support their team of missionaries.

I’ve spent my 15+ years in tech gaining tons of depth in digital product development plus [range](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484) across all the other business disciplines in a variety of markets. I want to leverage my experience, my strength in learning quickly, and ability to translate and communicate to help organizations move forward in a better way.

Digital product development is ***hard***. Many common models for developing them are a bad fit for so many companies and don't align incentives properly. Even if you have access to tons of talent, funding, and expertise you need a whole lot of luck to succeed.

There are ways to improve your odds though.

I am making a bet that I can develop services that are less transactional and give organizations that are in a few sweet spots a better chance at success by working with me for a few months.

## Guardrails

I am unashamedly treating my consulting business as a “lifestyle business.” I don’t want to grow a big agency.

What I do want is to provide tons of value to clients, support a comfortable life for my family, but also create more flexibility. I want to be very involved with my son before he goes to school. I also want to give back to the community more than I have been.

Professionally, my goal is be able to carve out [20% time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project) to experiment with new ideas that interest me in markets I have less experience in but lots of interest.

I want to help as many organizations as I can within that framework, with the hope that I find a new spark in the process.

## My mission

I'm a builder at heart. My mission during this phase is to search for a market where I can build a business that produces what is best represented by the [meme of “Ikigai.”](https://theviewinside.me/what-is-your-ikigai/)

![ikigai](/img/ikigai.png "Ikigai")

I want to do what I’m good at building something I'm interested in that makes money and makes the world better if even in a small way, while living as many [great days](/core-values) as I can. [Productive entrepreneurship](https://hbr.org/2017/06/is-america-encouraging-the-wrong-kind-of-entrepreneurship) plus a good life.

It typically takes 5-15 years to see a product business through to maturity, assuming it doesn't fail completely along the way.

When the time is right to devote my working life fully to building something new, I hope to be confident I've found the right "spot" to make my professional home. The best environment to produce ikigai along the way for me, my family, and as many others as possible.

This is the way.
