        I act as a fractional CPO, CTO, and coach for companies in a few sweet spots depending on their needs. I specialize in executive level support and coaching on product and/or tech strategy and direction, technology translation, product team hiring and lifecycle support, execution assistance, and measuring success in more effective ways.

        (Acquired November 2020) I led the Product functions for this enterprise focused personalization scale up, now a Wunderkind company. In 2017 I "boomeranged" back to take over leadership of product management, product marketing, and product design functions. I led program management of a troubled technology platform migration to completion, a product marketing overhaul, multiple new feature launches, and a complete user and buyer research study informing the future vision of the platform. I contributed major support throughout a strategic acquisition process and close, and led initial technology integration efforts with the new parent company from the SmarterHQ side.

        (Merged with Home Advisor October 2017) I led product teams in a growing capacity during a time of change for Angie's List. First focusing on technical platform products for strategic partnerships, I expanded to take over leadership of the product teams for service providers and then eventually added customer acquisition and retention for both sides of the marketplace in addition to reviews. As part of the merger with HomeAdvisor, I led the technical integration team from the Angie's List side to an on time launch of the integrated service request funnel.

        (IP Acquired August 2015) Co-founded and led the technology and product functions for Haven, a consumer focused home management marketplace product. I built the core of the product from scratch and led the growing product team after we raised 1M in seed funding, built and launched the initial version to the Indianapolis market. When initial growth stalled and additional funding was not secured, I helped with the sale of our intellectual property and wind-down of the company.

        (Closed Series A January 2014 led by Battery Ventures) Joined as one of the first few employees at SmarterRemarketer, which later rebranded as SmarterHQ. When I joined it was a scrappy enterprise marketing automation startup founded by ExactTarget and data science veterans with a huge vision. As an early engineer, I built core pieces of the product and started and scaled the dedicated technical implementation team and tools as the company grew through closing its $8M series A round from Battery Ventures.

        (Acquired January 2011 by Teradata) Boarded the Aprimo rocket ship mid flight and learned a ton from a lot of great and talented people. Worked as a software engineer on several teams including the flagship MRM product and the reporting and analytics MPM product before moving to work on the first full fledged SAAS offering Aprimo Marketing Studio up through the company's acquisition for $550M by Teradata.
