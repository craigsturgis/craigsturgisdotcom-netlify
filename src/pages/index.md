        I lead Product Management, Product Marketing, and Design/UX for this enterprise focused personalization platform scale up. I've "boomeranged" back to work with some old friends, some new ones, and take on a new challenge for a company in a phase I hadn't experienced before targeting a market I cut my teeth in as an engineer but had not approached as a product person previously.

        In my spare time, I act as a consultant where I can apply my experience to help and we can learn together. I've consulted in many different capacities, but I really like to help align sales, marketing, finance, product, UX, tech, customer success, and even just day to day productivity and execution in a customer focused, business aware way.

        I led product teams in a growing capacity during a time of change for Angie's List. First focusing on technical platform products for strategic partnerships, I expanded to take over the product teams for service providers and then eventually acquisition and retention for both sides of the marketplace. I led the technical integration team from the Angie's List side in a product capacity through the merger with Home Advisor to an on time launch.

        Co-founded and led the technical and product functions for this consumer focused home management marketplace product. I built the core of the product from scratch and lead the product team after we raised 1M in seed funding, built and launched the initial version to the Indianapolis market and through the acquisition of our intellectual property and wind-down of the company.

        Joined as one of the first few employees at this scrappy enterprise marketing automation startup then called SmarterRemarketer founded by ExactTarget and data science veterans with a huge vision. As an early engineer, I built core pieces of the product and started and scaled the dedicated technical implementation function as the company grew through closing its $8M series A round from Battery Ventures.

        Boarded a rocket ship mid flight and learned a ton from a lot of great and talented people. Worked as an engineer on several teams including the flagship MRM product and the reporting and analytics MPM product before moving to work on the first full fledged SAAS product Aprimo Marketing Studio up through the company's acquisition for $550M by Teradata.

  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
